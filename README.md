# room-lightning-model
This code serves as a simplified simulation to demonstrate the concept of agent-based control in a room lighting scenario. The purpose is to showcase how an agent can make decisions based on the environment's status to control the lighting and maintain an optimal lighting conditions.

# Features
The program simulates a room with controllable lighting and an agent that interacts with the environment.
The room's status can be either dark or not dark (bright), and the agent takes action accordingly.
The simulation runs for a specified number of iterations, displaying the current room status and the agent's next action.
Getting Started

# Prerequisites
To compile and run the program, you need a C++ compiler and a compatible development environment installed on your machine.

# Compilation
Clone the repository or download the source code files.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code.

Compile the code using the appropriate compiler command. For example, with G++:
g++ Room-lighting-simulation-AIClass.cpp -o room_lighting_simulation

# Usage
Run the compiled executable file. For example:
./room_lighting_simulation
The program will simulate the room lighting control for a specified number of iterations (default: 10).

The current room status and the agent's next action will be displayed for each iteration.

# Customization
You can customize the simulation by modifying the following parameters in the code:

NUM_ITERATIONS: The number of iterations for the simulation to run.
Other parameters specific to the behavior of the agent or the environment can be modified as needed.
